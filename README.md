# 🏎️ F1 Driver Performance Analyzer

An interactive, multi-view dashboard built with Python and Streamlit to analyze and compare Formula 1 driver performance from historical race data.

This application provides a suite of tools for exploring lap times, comparing drivers head-to-head, analyzing teammate performance, breaking down stints, and even uses a machine learning model to generate a performance score for each driver.

## ✨ Key Features

### Modern Tabbed Dashboard
A clean, intuitive user interface built with `st.tabs` that organizes different analyses into logical sections for easy navigation.

### Interactive Data Visualization
All charts are created with Plotly for a rich, interactive experience, including tooltips, zoom, and pan capabilities.

### Comprehensive Analysis Views
- **Summary Insights**: High-level metrics at a glance, including fastest average lap, most consistent stint, and biggest performance drop-off.
- **Driver vs. Driver**: A head-to-head lap time comparison between any two drivers in the race.
- **Teammate Comparison**: The ultimate F1 benchmark, comparing two drivers in the same machinery.
- **Stint & Tyre Performance**: Analyze pace degradation and performance across different tire stints and compounds.

### AI-Powered Scoring
Integrates a pre-trained Scikit-learn model (`driver_score_model.pkl`) to generate a performance score for each driver based on key race metrics, with results displayed in a styled table.

### Robust Data Handling
The app gracefully handles different data formats and includes checks for missing or invalid data to ensure a smooth user experience.

### Dynamic Filtering
Users can easily select the **year** and **race** they want to analyze from the available data.
